   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to tlsfuzzer!
=====================

``tlsfuzzer`` tests :term:`SSL` and :term:`TLS` implementations.

It allows for testing standards-compliance of a given implementation, testing
for presence of known vulnerabilities as well as fuzzing of the :term:`SSL`
and :term:`TLS` connections.

You can find ready to use scripts that test significant parts of :term:`TLS`
protocols in the source repository.

The testing of OpenSSL, GnuTLS,
`NSS <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS>`_, and
other implementations commonly includes running tlsfuzzer test cases.

While tlsfuzzer doesn't support some features of :term:`TLS`,
it includes the most commonly used ones:
:term:`TLS` 1.2, :term:`TLS` 1.3, :term:`RSA` certificates, :term:`ECDSA`
certificates, :term:`ECDHE` key exchange, client certificates, :term:`AES-GCM`,
Chacha20-Poly1305 ciphers, etc.
See the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/tomato42/tlsfuzzer/issues>`_ on GitHub
to see wanted, but not yet implemented features.
